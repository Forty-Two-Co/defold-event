# Event

**Event** is an event system for the [Defold](https://defold.com/) game engine. It provides events, queues, promises, and global messaging using a publish-subscribe pattern. Events are triggered instantly and automatically preserve script context, allowing you to call events from any context.


## Features

- **Event Management**: Create, trigger, subscribe, unsubscribe to events.
- **Cross-Context**: You can subscribe to events from different scripts.
- **Callback Management**: Attach callbacks to events with optional context.
- **Global Events**: Use string identifiers to trigger events from anywhere in your game.
- **Queue**: Store events in a queue until they are processed by subscribers.
- **Global Queues**: Access queue instances from anywhere in your game using string identifiers.
- **Promise**: Handle asynchronous operations with promise-style chaining.
- **Logging**: Set a logger to log event activities.


## Setup

### [Dependency](https://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/)

Open your `game.project` file and add the following line to the dependencies field under the project section:

**[Defold Event](https://github.com/Insality/defold-event/archive/refs/tags/13.zip)**

```
https://github.com/Insality/defold-event/archive/refs/tags/13.zip
```

### Library Size

> **Note:** The library size is calculated based on the build report per platform
> Events, Queues, and Promise modules will be included in the build only if you use them.

| Platform         | Event Size   | Events Size   | Queue Size   | Queues Size  | Promise Size |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| HTML5            | **1.68 KB**  | **0.41 KB**   | **1.11 KB**  | **0.49 KB**  | **1.74 KB**  |
| Desktop / Mobile | **2.88 KB**  | **0.71 KB**   | **2.03 KB**  | **0.97 KB**  | **3.22 KB**  |


## Event Mode

Event module can work in 3 modes:

| Mode | Default | Cross-Context | Error Behavior | Tracebacks | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pcall` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | **Continue on error** | Basic | Errors are logged, other subscribers still run, code after trigger continues. |
| `xpcall` | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | **Continue on error** | Full | Same as pcall but with detailed tracebacks. More memory usage. |
| `none` | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | **Stop on error** | Full | Error stops all execution immediately. No cross-context support. |

You can set the Event Mode with code:

```lua
event.set_mode("pcall")
event.set_mode("xpcall")
event.set_mode("none")
```

## What is context?

Context is the script context where the event is triggered. It can be a GO script or a GUI script in Defold. Without context changing, you can't call `gui.set_text` from GO script for example.

## Error Behavior

**Continue on error** (`pcall` and `xpcall` modes):
- If one subscriber throws an error, it gets logged but other subscribers still run
- Code after `event:trigger()` continues executing

**Stop on error** (`none` mode):
- If any subscriber throws an error, execution stops immediately
- No more subscribers are called, code after `event:trigger()` doesn't run
- **Important limitation**: Cross-context switching is disabled. Callbacks execute in the trigger's context rather than their subscription context, which removes the primary advantage of this event system over standard Lua function calls

The mode setting is global and affects all events in your project.

**Recommendation**: Use `pcall` for production (safe, fast) and `xpcall` for debugging (detailed errors).

## API Reference

### Quick API Reference

```lua
local event = require("event.event")
event.set_logger([logger])
event.set_mode("pcall" | "xpcall" | "none")

local object = event.create([callback], [callback_context])
object(...)
object:trigger(...)
object:subscribe(callback, [callback_context])
object:unsubscribe(callback, [callback_context])
object:is_subscribed(callback, [callback_context])
object:is_empty()
object:clear()

local events = require("event.events")
events(event_id, ...)
events.trigger(event_id, ...)
events.subscribe(event_id, callback, [callback_context])
events.unsubscribe(event_id, callback, [callback_context])
events.is_subscribed(event_id, callback, [callback_context])
events.is_empty(event_id)
events.clear(event_id)
events.clear_all()
```

## Changelog

<details>

### **V1**
	- Initial release

### **V2**
	- Add global events module
	- The `event:subscribe` and `event:unsubscribe` now return boolean value of success

### **V3**
	- Event Trigger now returns value of last executed callback
	- Add `events.is_empty(name)` function
	- Add tests for Event and Global Events modules


### **V4**
	- Rename `lua_script_instance` to `event_context_manager` to escape conflicts with `lua_script_instance` library
	- Fix validate context in `event_context_manager.set`
	- Better error messages in case of invalid context
	- Refactor `event_context_manager`
	- Add `event.set_memory_threshold` function. Works only in debug builds.

### **V5**
	- The `event:trigger(...)` can be called as `event(...)` via `__call` metamethod
	- Add default pprint logger. Remove or replace it with `event.set_logger()`
	- Add tests for context changing

### **V6**
	- Optimize memory allocations per event instance
	- Localize functions in the event module for better performance

### **V7**
	- Optimize memory allocations per event instance
	- Default logger now empty except for errors

### **V8**
	- Optimize memory allocations per subscription (~35% less)

### **V9**
	- Better error tracebacks in case of error in subscription callback
	- Update annotations

### **V10**
	- The `event:unsubscribe` now removes all subscriptions with the same function if `callback_context` is not provided
	- You can use events instead callbacks in `event:subscribe` and `event:unsubscribe`. The subcribed event will be triggered by the parent event trigger.
	- Update docs and API reference

### **V11**
	- Introduced behavior in the `defer` module. The Defer module provides a queuing mechanism for events. Unlike regular events which are immediately processed, deferred events are stored in a queue until they are explicitly handled by a subscriber. This is useful for events that need to persist until they can be properly handled.
	- Add `use_xpcall` option to get full tracebacks in case of an error in the event callback.
	- Moved detailed API documentation to separate files
	- Remove annotations files. Now all annotations directly in the code.

### **V12**
	- **MIGRATION**: Replace `require("event.defer")` with `require("event.queues")` in case of using `defer` module

	- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Refactored defer system to be instance-based like event system. `defer.lua` now creates defer instances with `defer.create()` instead of global event_id system
	- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Renamed `defer` module to `queues` for better clarity
	- Removed memory allocation tracking feature
	- Added `queues.lua` for global queues operations (renamed from defer.lua functionality)
	- Added **Promise** module on top of event module
	- Fixed queue event processing order from LIFO to FIFO (events now processed in correct queue order)
	- Added no_context_change mode to disable context changing in event callback and using `pcall` by default
	- Added `event.set_mode` function to set the event mode

### **V13**
	- Added `queue:process_next` function to process exactly one event in the queue with a specific handler (subscribers will not be called)
	- Make `promise:resolve` and `promise:reject` public functions
	- Added `promise:append` function to append a task to the promise
	- Added `promise:tail` and `promise:reset` functions to manage the promise tail
