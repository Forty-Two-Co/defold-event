# Event

**Event** is an event system for the [Defold](https://defold.com/) game engine. It provides events, queues, promises, and global messaging using a publish-subscribe pattern. Events are triggered instantly and automatically preserve script context, allowing you to call events from any context.


## Features

- **Event Management**: Create, subscribe, unsubscribe, and trigger events.
- **Cross-Context**: You can subscribe to events from different scripts.
- **Callback Management**: Attach callbacks to events with optional data.
- **Global Events**: Create and subscribe global events that can be triggered from anywhere in your game.
- **Queue**: Create queue instances to queue events until they are handled by subscribers. Unlike regular events which are immediately processed, queued events are stored in a queue until they are explicitly handled.
- **Global Queues**: Create and subscribe global queue instances that can be accessed from anywhere in your game.
- **Promise**: A promise implementation built on top of the event system for asynchronous operations and chaining.
- **Logging**: Set a logger to log event activities.


## Setup

### [Dependency](https://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/)

Open your `game.project` file and add the following line to the dependencies field under the project section:

**[Defold Event](https://github.com/Insality/defold-event/archive/refs/tags/13.zip)**

```
https://github.com/Insality/defold-event/archive/refs/tags/13.zip
```

### Library Size

> **Note:** The library size is calculated based on the build report per platform
> Events, Queues, and Promise modules will be included in the build only if you use them.

| Platform         | Event Size   | Events Size   | Queue Size   | Queues Size  | Promise Size |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| HTML5            | **1.68 KB**  | **0.41 KB**   | **1.11 KB**  | **0.49 KB**  | **1.74 KB**  |
| Desktop / Mobile | **2.88 KB**  | **0.71 KB**   | **2.03 KB**  | **0.97 KB**  | **3.22 KB**  |


## Event Mode

Event module can work in 3 modes:

| Mode | Default | Cross-Context | Detailed Tracebacks | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pcall` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Uses `pcall` function to handle subscribers. |
| `xpcall` | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Uses `xpcall` function to handle subscribers. More memory allocations per `event:trigger` call. |
| `none` | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | The error will be thrown as usual Lua error. |

You can set the Event Mode with code:

```lua
event.set_mode("pcall")
event.set_mode("xpcall")
event.set_mode("none")
```

## What is context?

Context is the script context where the event is triggered. It can be a GO script or a GUI script in Defold. Without context changing, you can't call `gui.set_text` from GO script for example.

The context changing is disabled in case of `none` mode. That means the event callback will be executed in the same context as the event trigger, which can lead to unexpected behavior. With `pcall` (default) the subscribed callback will be executed in the same context where created.

The `xpcall` mode is more verbose than `pcall` mode. It will return a detailed traceback in case of an error in the event callback. But the drawback of it is memory allocations per `event:trigger` call. Currently, I'm recommending to use `pcall` mode for production builds and `xpcall` mode for debugging purposes.

## API Reference

### Quick API Reference

```lua
local event = require("event.event")
event.set_logger([logger])
event.set_mode("pcall" | "xpcall" | "none")

local event_instance = event.create([callback], [callback_context])
event_instance(...)
event_instance:trigger(...)
event_instance:subscribe(callback, [callback_context])
event_instance:unsubscribe(callback, [callback_context])
event_instance:is_subscribed(callback, [callback_context])
event_instance:is_empty()
event_instance:clear()

local events = require("event.events")
events.trigger(event_id, ...)
events.subscribe(event_id, callback, [callback_context])
events.unsubscribe(event_id, callback, [callback_context])
events.is_subscribed(event_id, callback, [callback_context])
events.is_empty(event_id)
events.clear(event_id)
events.clear_all()
```

## Changelog

<details>

### **V1**
	- Initial release

### **V2**
	- Add global events module
	- The `event:subscribe` and `event:unsubscribe` now return boolean value of success

### **V3**
	- Event Trigger now returns value of last executed callback
	- Add `events.is_empty(name)` function
	- Add tests for Event and Global Events modules


### **V4**
	- Rename `lua_script_instance` to `event_context_manager` to escape conflicts with `lua_script_instance` library
	- Fix validate context in `event_context_manager.set`
	- Better error messages in case of invalid context
	- Refactor `event_context_manager`
	- Add `event.set_memory_threshold` function. Works only in debug builds.

### **V5**
	- The `event:trigger(...)` can be called as `event(...)` via `__call` metamethod
	- Add default pprint logger. Remove or replace it with `event.set_logger()`
	- Add tests for context changing

### **V6**
	- Optimize memory allocations per event instance
	- Localize functions in the event module for better performance

### **V7**
	- Optimize memory allocations per event instance
	- Default logger now empty except for errors

### **V8**
	- Optimize memory allocations per subscription (~35% less)

### **V9**
	- Better error tracebacks in case of error in subscription callback
	- Update annotations

### **V10**
	- The `event:unsubscribe` now removes all subscriptions with the same function if `callback_context` is not provided
	- You can use events instead callbacks in `event:subscribe` and `event:unsubscribe`. The subcribed event will be triggered by the parent event trigger.
	- Update docs and API reference

### **V11**
	- Introduced behavior in the `defer` module. The Defer module provides a queuing mechanism for events. Unlike regular events which are immediately processed, deferred events are stored in a queue until they are explicitly handled by a subscriber. This is useful for events that need to persist until they can be properly handled.
	- Add `use_xpcall` option to get detailed tracebacks in case of an error in the event callback.
	- Moved detailed API documentation to separate files
	- Remove annotations files. Now all annotations directly in the code.

### **V12**
	- **MIGRATION**: Replace `require("event.defer")` with `require("event.queues")` in case of using `defer` module

	- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Refactored defer system to be instance-based like event system. `defer.lua` now creates defer instances with `defer.create()` instead of global event_id system
	- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Renamed `defer` module to `queues` for better clarity
	- Removed memory allocation tracking feature
	- Added `queues.lua` for global queues operations (renamed from defer.lua functionality)
	- Added **Promise** module on top of event module
	- Fixed queue event processing order from LIFO to FIFO (events now processed in correct queue order)
	- Added no_context_change mode to disable context changing in event callback and using `pcall` by default
	- Added `event.set_mode` function to set the event mode

### **V13**
	- Added `queue:process_next` function to process exactly one event in the queue with a specific handler (subscribers will not be called)
	- Make `promise:resolve` and `promise:reject` public functions
	- Added `promise:append` function to append a task to the promise
	- Added `promise:tail` and `promise:reset` functions to manage the promise tail
